# Advanced Machine Learning for Predicting Bioaccessibility of Cd, Pb, and As

## Introduction
This code repository contains the machine learning models and analysis used in the study "Utilizing Advanced Machine Learning Approaches for Predicting Bioaccessibility of Cd, Pb, and As: Informing Soil Environmental Criteria Derivation in Chinese Sites". We leverage ensemble learning algorithms to predict the bioaccessibility of Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), and Arsenic (As) in soil, aiming to inform the derivation of soil environmental criteria in Chinese contexts.
